patternpathmatcher
==================

Coding exercise to find a best match pattern for each path in a list of paths

To run the pattern/path analyzer program, please run the command as follows. 

java -cp WP.jar Main

As long as you have the java.exe in your PATH, this should work ok.
The only files that need other non J2SE libraries are the unit tests.
